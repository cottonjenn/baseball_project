Here is how you use my package:

```{python}
from final_project_demo import add

print(add(2, 19))
```
have code that actually runs to demonstrate the package actually runs

```{python}
from final_project_demo import run_analysis_pipeline, run_cleaning_pipeling

run_cleaning_pipeling()
run_analysis_pipeline()
```
